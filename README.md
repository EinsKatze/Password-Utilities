# Password Utilities [UWP]

**Password Utilities** is a *universal Windows Platform* Application which gives u some cool password tools for your day.

## Installation
Currently there is no way to install the app unless you compile it yourself.

Which is ([see issue #1](https://github.com/EinsKatze/Password-Utilities/issues/1)) not possible at the moment.

Repository updates multiple times a day so this should be fixed by tomorrow or the day after.
